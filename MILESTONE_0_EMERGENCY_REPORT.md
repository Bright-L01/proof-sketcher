# Milestone 0: Emergency Triage & Security Report

**Period**: 2025-07-08 to 2025-07-09
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Next Phase**: Continue technical debt reduction

## Executive Summary

Emergency triage phase completed with critical security vulnerabilities addressed and core dependency stabilization achieved. The codebase remains in alpha state but is now more secure and has a clear path forward.

## Completed Milestones

### Milestone 0.1: Security Emergency Response ✅

#### Achievements
1. **Security Scan Results**
   - Identified 69 total vulnerabilities (6 HIGH, 15 MEDIUM, 48 LOW)
   - Fixed all HIGH severity code vulnerabilities
   - Created comprehensive security framework

2. **Fixes Implemented**
   - ✅ XSS vulnerability fixed with autoescape=True
   - ✅ MD5 replaced with SHA-256 hashing
   - ✅ Pickle replaced with SafeSerializer (JSON-based)
   - ✅ Created security validation utilities
   - ✅ Added SecurityError to exception hierarchy

3. **Security Infrastructure**
   - Created `src/proof_sketcher/utils/security.py`
   - Created `src/proof_sketcher/utils/safe_serialization.py`
   - Added comprehensive security tests

### Milestone 0.2: Stabilize Core Dependencies ✅

#### Achievements
1. **Fixed Broken Claude Integration**
   - Identified subprocess calling non-existent 'claude' CLI
   - Created new AI client architecture
   - Implemented AnthropicClient with official SDK
   - Added offline fallback capability

2. **New Components Created**
   - `src/proof_sketcher/ai/base_client.py` - Abstract base class
   - `src/proof_sketcher/ai/anthropic_client.py` - SDK integration
   - `src/proof_sketcher/ai/offline_client.py` - Fallback templates
   - `src/proof_sketcher/generator/ai_generator_fixed.py` - Fixed generator
   - `tests/test_ai_integration.py` - Comprehensive tests (94% pass rate)

### Milestone 0.3: Technical Debt Inventory ✅

#### Achievements
1. **Created Debt Tracking System**
   - `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` - Comprehensive inventory
   - `src/proof_sketcher/utils/debt_tracker.py` - Programmatic tracking
   - `technical_debt.json` - Structured debt database

2. **Honest Documentation**
   - `PRODUCTION_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md` - Clear NO-GO decision
   - Updated README with honest status
   - Created realistic timeline (6-8 weeks to production)

## Key Metrics

### Before Emergency Triage
- HIGH security vulnerabilities: 6
- Broken AI integration: 100% failure
- Technical debt visibility: None
- Production readiness: Unknown

### After Emergency Triage
- HIGH security vulnerabilities: 3 (in dependencies only)
- AI integration: Working with fallback
- Technical debt visibility: Full inventory
- Production readiness: Clear assessment (NOT READY)

## Critical Issues Remaining

1. **Lean Parser** - Still returns empty statements (BLOCKER)
2. **Test Coverage** - Still at 11% (target 90%)
3. **MCP Integration** - Animation generation broken
4. **Dependencies** - 15 vulnerable packages
5. **Code Quality** - 3,625 violations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Honesty First** - Replaced all false claims with reality
2. **Security Critical** - Cannot ignore vulnerabilities
3. **Core First** - Parser must work before anything else
4. **Debt Visible** - Tracking system essential for progress

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Fix Lean parser - highest priority
2. Update vulnerable dependencies
3. Increase test coverage to 50%

### Short Term (Week 2-3)
1. Fix MCP integration
2. Reduce code violations <100
3. Achieve 70% test coverage

### Medium Term (Week 4-6)
1. Complete documentation
2. Performance optimization
3. Achieve 90% test coverage

## Recommendations

1. **DO NOT attempt to add new features**
2. **DO NOT deploy to any public environment**
3. **DO focus exclusively on technical debt**
4. **DO maintain honest communication**

## Team Notes

The emergency triage phase has stabilized the most critical issues, but significant work remains. The codebase is more secure but still not functional for its primary purpose. Continue with disciplined debt reduction before considering any new development.
