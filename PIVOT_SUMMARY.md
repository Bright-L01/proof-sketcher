# Proof Sketcher Pivot Summary

## Emergency Surgery Complete ✅

### What We Did (Brutal Honesty)

1. **Deleted 8,000+ lines of code**:
   - 6,470 lines of animation system (Manim integration)
   - 567 lines of duplicate export system
   - ~1,000 lines of animation tests
   - Various animation references throughout

2. **Fixed type safety** (accidentally):
   - Started with "60+ type errors"
   - After removing animation: Only 2 minor errors!
   - Turns out most type errors were in the animation system

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - Rewrote README with new vision
   - Clear pivot to doc-gen4 enhancer
   - Honest about current broken state

### Current State

#### What Works ✅
- Basic Lean parsing (simple theorems only)
- Export to HTML/Markdown (without animations)
- CLI structure intact
- Core architecture cleaner

#### What's Broken ❌
- Many tests fail (expected - they test removed features)
- Some imports need cleanup
- Architecture still needs redesign
- No doc-gen4 integration yet

### Surprising Discovery

**Type errors dropped from 60+ to 2!** 

The animation system was the source of most type safety issues. By removing it, we accidentally fixed the type safety problem. The remaining 2 errors are trivial:
1. Missing type stubs for `tqdm` 
2. Module path configuration issue

### Test Situation

- **754 tests collected** (many will fail)
- Many test files import removed modules
- Tests need major overhaul to match new vision

### Next Steps (Prioritized)

#### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Fix remaining tests** or remove outdated ones
2. **Clean up remaining imports**
3. **Research doc-gen4 integration**
4. **Prototype simple enhancer**

#### Short Term (Next Week)
1. **Build doc-gen4 adapter**
2. **Implement basic natural language generation**
3. **Create simple static diagrams**
4. **Write new tests for new functionality**

#### Medium Term (Week 3-4)
1. **Clean architecture implementation**
2. **Beta release as doc-gen4 enhancer**
3. **Documentation and examples**
4. **Community feedback integration**

## Lessons Learned

1. **Feature creep kills projects** - We tried to do too much
2. **Complex integrations add fragility** - Manim was a mistake
3. **Don't compete with established tools** - Enhance them instead
4. **Type safety matters** - But it was hiding in the wrong code
5. **Brutal honesty helps** - This pivot was necessary

## The Good News

- **Cleaner codebase** - 8,000 fewer lines to maintain
- **Clearer vision** - doc-gen4 enhancer, not competitor
- **Better type safety** - Almost all errors gone
- **Focused scope** - Do one thing well

## The Reality Check

- **Still not functional** - Major work needed
- **Tests are broken** - Expected but needs fixing
- **No users yet** - Good time for breaking changes
- **Architecture needs work** - But now it's manageable

## Final Verdict

The emergency surgery was successful. Patient (codebase) is stable but needs rehabilitation. The pivot from "Manim-powered documentation generator" to "doc-gen4 enhancer" is the right move.

**Bottom Line**: We removed the cancer (animation system) and now we can rebuild properly.
