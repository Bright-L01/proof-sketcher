  - `pyproject.toml`: `version = "0.0.1a1"`
- **Status**: Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha

### 2. Package Metadata
- **Description**: "Experimental documentation generator for Lean 4 (ALPHA)"
- **Keywords**: Added "experimental", "alpha"
- **Classifiers**: Set to Pre-Alpha status
- **Dependencies**: All security-critical versions updated

### 3. Security & Quality Checks

- **Ruff**: 74 minor style issues (non-critical)
- **Mypy**: Type checking issues with imports (expected)
- **Twine**: Package checks PASSED ✅

### 4. Alpha Warning System

  - Markdown: Warning block
  - PDF: LaTeX warning box
- **Verified**: Warnings display correctly in all outputs

### 5. Documentation
- **README.md**: Brutally honest about limitations
- **KNOWN_ISSUES.md**: 12 documented issues with severity
- **RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md**: Comprehensive with warnings
- **PHASE_4_ALPHA_RELEASE_SUMMARY.md**: Detailed assessment

### 6. Build & Test
- **Packages Built**:
  - `proof_sketcher-0.0.1a1-py3-none-any.whl` (327KB)
  - `proof_sketcher-0.0.1a1.tar.gz` (302KB)
- **Local Test**: ✅ Package installs and runs
- **Version Check**: ✅ Shows 0.0.1a1
- **Alpha Warning**: ✅ Displays on all commands

## Ready for TestPyPI Upload

### Upload Command (DO NOT use production PyPI):
```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI ONLY
twine upload -r testpypi dist/*

# Alternative if no config:
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```

### Post-Upload Testing:
```bash
# Install from TestPyPI
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ proof-sketcher==0.0.1a1

# May need dependencies from regular PyPI
pip install click pydantic rich jinja2 PyYAML
```

## Brutal Honesty Assessment

### What We Actually Have
1. **Working**:
   - Basic Lean parsing (simple syntax only)
   - Static diagram generation
   - Export to HTML/Markdown/PDF
   - Alpha warnings throughout
   - Graceful degradation

2. **Not Working**:
   - Complex Lean parsing (most real theorems)
   - Manim animations (fragile)
   - Memory efficiency
   - Production features

3. **Infrastructure Issues**:
   - Export system duplication documented
   - Model enhancements applied
   - Matplotlib compatibility fixed

### Real Test Coverage
- **Actual**: ~24% (NOT the 60% initially claimed)
- **35 tests** for Phase 3 features pass
- Core functionality tested
- Many edge cases not covered

### Known Limitations
1. **Parser**: Only handles basic Lean syntax
2. **Animation**: Works ~20% of the time
3. **Memory**: Loads entire files
4. **Architecture**: Duplicate export systems
5. **Error Handling**: Basic only

## Recommendations

### For TestPyPI Upload
1. **DO**: Upload to TestPyPI for testing
2. **DO NOT**: Upload to production PyPI
3. **DO**: Test thoroughly after upload
4. **DO**: Announce as experimental alpha

### For Users
- Use for simple examples only
- Expect many failures
- Report issues to help development
- Understand it's experimental

### For Next Release (Alpha 2)
1. Consolidate export systems
2. Improve parser capabilities
3. Optimize memory usage
4. Enhance error handling
5. Add progress indicators

## Final Verdict

**Status**: READY FOR TESTPYPI ✅

The alpha release is honest about its limitations and ready for experimental testing. All warnings are in place, documentation is transparent, and the package builds/installs correctly.

### Critical Reminders
- ⚠️ TestPyPI ONLY - NOT production PyPI
- ⚠️ Version is 0.0.1a1 - NOT 1.0.0
- ⚠️ This is experimental software
- ⚠️ Many features don't work as expected
