# Security Policy

## Overview

Proof Sketcher is committed to maintaining the highest security standards. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and security-related configurations.

## Security Measures

### üîí Automated Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning:

- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Semgrep**: Advanced static analysis for security patterns
- **MyPy**: Type checking to prevent type-related vulnerabilities

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality Controls

- **Ruff**: Modern Python linter with security-focused rules
- **Black**: Consistent code formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automated checks before commits
- **Radon**: Code complexity analysis
- **Vulture**: Dead code detection

### üîç Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Error Handling**: Specific exception handling prevents information leakage
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
4. **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets or credentials
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints and strict MyPy configuration

## Supported Versions

We currently support security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üö® For Critical/High Severity Issues

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security reports to: [your-security-email@example.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

### üìß Security Contact

- **Email**: [your-security-email@example.com]
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours
- **Resolution Time**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

### üèÜ Security Acknowledgments

We maintain a hall of fame for security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Contributors will be publicly acknowledged (with permission) after issues are resolved.

## Security Configuration

### Development Environment

```bash
# Install security tools
pip install bandit safety semgrep

# Run security scans
bandit -r src/ -f txt
safety check
semgrep --config=auto src/

# Setup pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### CI/CD Security Gates

Our continuous integration includes:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: Automatic vulnerability detection
2. **Static Analysis**: Multi-tool security analysis
3. **Type Checking**: Strict type validation
4. **Code Quality**: Complexity and maintainability checks

### Security Headers and Configuration

- All external communications use secure protocols
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Error messages do not expose internal details
- Resource limits prevent DoS attacks

## Security Considerations for Users

### üîê Installation Security

- Always install from official sources (PyPI, GitHub releases)
- Verify package integrity when possible
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies

### üõ°Ô∏è Usage Security

- **File Permissions**: Ensure Lean files have appropriate permissions
- **Output Directories**: Be cautious with output directory permissions
- **Cache Security**: Cache directories may contain sensitive theorem data
- **API Usage**: Claude CLI credentials should be properly secured

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Limitations

- **Lean Code Execution**: Proof Sketcher executes Lean code, ensure files are trusted
- **External Dependencies**: We depend on Lean 4, Claude CLI, and optional Manim
- **File System Access**: The tool requires read/write access for processing
- **Network Access**: AI generation requires internet connectivity

## Security Roadmap

### Planned Security Enhancements

- [ ] Add SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- [ ] Implement content security policies for HTML output
- [ ] Add digital signatures for releases
- [ ] Create security-focused documentation
- [ ] Implement sandboxed Lean execution

### Security Metrics

We track:
- Vulnerability discovery and resolution time
- Dependency freshness
- Code coverage of security tests
- Static analysis rule coverage

## Compliance and Standards

Proof Sketcher follows:
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Web application security practices
- **CVE Standards**: Common vulnerability scoring and reporting
- **Semantic Versioning**: Security-aware version management
- **Open Source Security**: Transparent security practices

## Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and severity
2. **Containment**: Implement immediate fixes
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users
4. **Resolution**: Deploy patches and updates
5. **Post-mortem**: Analyze and improve processes

## Contact Information

- **Security Team**: [your-security-email@example.com]
- **General Contact**: [your-email@example.com]
- **GitHub Issues**: For non-security bugs only
