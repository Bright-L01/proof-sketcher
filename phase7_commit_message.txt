feat: complete Phase 7 - Project Phoenix MVP restoration

BREAKING CHANGE: Complete rewrite with minimal functionality

Major changes:
- Deleted 70+ documentation/report files
- Removed 35+ test/demo Python scripts
- Removed all PNG files and temp directories
- Removed duplicate implementations
- Fixed test imports after cleanup

Core functionality restored:
- SimpleLeanParser: Basic regex-based theorem extraction
- SimpleGenerator: Template-based offline generation
- SimpleMarkdownExporter: Basic markdown output
- test_mvp_pipeline.py: Integration test proving it works

Project state:
- Root directory: 29 files (was 100+)
- Working pipeline: Lean → Parse → Generate → Markdown
- README updated to reflect actual functionality
- All non-essential code removed

This commit establishes the MVP foundation. The project now has
one working path that can be gradually enhanced.
