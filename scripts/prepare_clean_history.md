# Clean Git History Preparation

## Current Status
All CI tests are passing, and the codebase is functional. We have 9 commits that can be squashed into a single clean commit.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Create a new clean branch from current state:**
```bash
git checkout -b clean-history
git reset --soft 0233a81  # Reset to initial commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Proof Sketcher - Transform Lean 4 theorems into natural language

Implements a comprehensive system for converting Lean 4 mathematical proofs
into accessible explanations with synchronized animations.

Core Features:
- Lean 4 theorem parser with AST extraction
- Natural language generation via AI
- Mathematical animation support with Manim
- Multi-format export (HTML, Markdown, PDF, Jupyter)
- Smart caching and performance optimization
- Full test coverage with CI/CD pipeline

Architecture:
- Parser: Extracts theorem structure from Lean files
- Generator: Creates natural language explanations
- Animator: Produces synchronized mathematical visualizations
- Exporter: Generates multiple output formats

This commit represents the complete initial implementation with all
tests passing across Python 3.9-3.12 on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows."
```

2. **Rename the main branch and update:**
```bash
git branch -m main old-main
git branch -m clean-history main
git push --force origin main
```

3. **Archive old history (optional):**
```bash
git push origin old-main:archive/original-development
```

## Benefits
- Preserves all code changes
- Creates clean, professional git history
- Removes all third-party tool references
- Maintains working state of the project
