   - ✅ Created unified visualization interface
   - ✅ Added batch processing support

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Multi-line F-string Syntax Errors**:
   - Problem: Automated fixes broke f-string formatting
   - Solution: Manual intervention for 7 files
   - Prevention: Updated quality_fixer.py logic

2. **Animation Timeout Issues**:
   - Problem: Manim could hang indefinitely
   - Solution: 30-second timeout with subprocess
   - Fallback: Automatic switch to static diagrams

3. **Resource Exhaustion**:
   - Problem: Large batch processing could exhaust memory
   - Solution: Comprehensive resource monitoring
   - Prevention: Configurable limits and cleanup
