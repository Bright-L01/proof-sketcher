# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback**
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
* **Being patient with learners** at all levels of mathematical sophistication
* **Providing helpful explanations** when answering questions
* **Acknowledging different mathematical perspectives** and proof approaches

### Mathematical Community Values

As a project focused on mathematical education and formal verification, we especially value:

* **Precision in communication** while remaining accessible
* **Constructive mathematical discourse** that builds understanding
* **Respect for different mathematical backgrounds** and learning styles
* **Encouragement of questions** from newcomers to formal mathematics
* **Collaborative problem-solving** and knowledge sharing
* **Recognition that learning is a journey** with different starting points

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination** in any form
* **The use of sexualized language or imagery**, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments**, and personal or political attacks
* **Public or private harassment**
* **Publishing others' private information**, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* **Mathematical elitism or gatekeeping** that discourages learning
* **Dismissive attitudes** toward questions or different levels of understanding
* **Condescending explanations** or "mansplaining"
* **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate** in a professional setting

### Technical Standards

In code reviews, issues, and technical discussions:

* **Focus on the code, not the person** writing it
* **Provide specific, actionable feedback** rather than vague criticism
* **Suggest improvements** rather than only pointing out problems
* **Be patient with different coding styles** and experience levels
* **Explain the reasoning** behind technical decisions
* **Acknowledge good work** and contributions

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Specific Scope Areas

This Code of Conduct applies to:

* **GitHub repositories** (issues, pull requests, discussions, code comments)
* **Documentation and examples** contributed to the project
* **Community forums and chat platforms** related to the project
* **Conference presentations and meetups** representing the project
* **Social media interactions** when representing the project
* **Private correspondence** related to project business

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: brightliu@college.harvard.edu

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Reporting Guidelines

When reporting, please include:

* **Your contact information** (so we can follow up with questions)
* **Names of individuals involved** (real names, usernames, or other identifiers)
