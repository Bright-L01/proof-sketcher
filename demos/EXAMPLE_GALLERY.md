## 🧮 Basic Mathematics

### Example 1: Natural Number Arithmetic

**Lean Source** (`examples/classical/simple_examples.lean`):
```lean
theorem nat_add_comm (n m : ℕ) : n + m = m + n := by
  exact Nat.add_comm n m

theorem nat_add_assoc (a b c : ℕ) : (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) := by
  exact Nat.add_assoc a b c
```

**Generated Explanation**:
> **Commutativity of Addition (nat_add_comm)**
>
> This fundamental theorem establishes that addition of natural numbers is commutative - the order of operands doesn't affect the result. For any natural numbers n and m, we have n + m = m + n.
>
> **Mathematical Significance**: This property is so fundamental that we often take it for granted, but it's actually a non-trivial result that must be proven from the basic axioms of natural numbers.
>
> **Proof Strategy**: The proof leverages Lean's built-in `Nat.add_comm` lemma, which is proven by induction on the first argument.

## 🔗 Group Theory

### Example 2: Identity Element Uniqueness

**Lean Source** (`examples/classical/group_theory.lean`):
```lean
theorem unique_identity (G : Type*) [Group G] :
  ∃! e : G, ∀ a : G, e * a = a ∧ a * e = a := by
  use 1
  constructor
  · intro a
    simp [one_mul, mul_one]
  · intro e' he'
    have h1 : e' = e' * 1 := by rw [mul_one]
    have h2 : e' * 1 = 1 := by
      have := he' 1
      rw [←this.1, one_mul]
    rw [h1, h2]
```

**Generated Explanation**:
> **Uniqueness of Identity Element**
>
> This theorem proves that every group has exactly one identity element. An identity element e satisfies e * a = a and a * e = a for all group elements a.
>
> **Proof Structure**:
> 1. **Existence**: We show that 1 (the designated identity) works
> 2. **Uniqueness**: We prove any other identity e' must equal 1
>
> **Key Insight**: The uniqueness proof elegantly uses the fact that if e' is an identity, then e' = e' * 1 = 1, where the first equality uses the right identity property and the second uses that 1 is a right identity.
>
> **Applications**: This result is foundational for group theory, ensuring that when we speak of "the" identity element, we're mathematically justified in using the definite article.

## 📊 Real Analysis

### Example 3: Supremum Property

**Lean Source** (`examples/classical/real_analysis.lean`):
```lean
theorem supremum_property (S : Set ℝ) (hne : S.Nonempty) (hbdd : BddAbove S) :
  ∃ sup : ℝ, IsLUB S sup := by
  exact Real.exists_isLUB hne hbdd

theorem squeeze_theorem {f g h : ℝ → ℝ} {a L : ℝ}
  (hfg : ∀ x, f x ≤ g x) (hgh : ∀ x, g x ≤ h x)
  (hf_lim : Tendsto f (𝓝 a) (𝓝 L)) (hh_lim : Tendsto h (𝓝 a) (𝓝 L)) :
  Tendsto g (𝓝 a) (𝓝 L) := by
  apply tendsto_of_tendsto_of_tendsto_of_le_of_le hf_lim hh_lim
  · exact eventually_of_forall hfg
  · exact eventually_of_forall hgh
```

**Generated Explanation**:
> **Completeness Property of Real Numbers**
>
> The supremum property is the defining characteristic of real numbers that distinguishes them from rational numbers. It states that every non-empty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum).
>
> **Mathematical Context**: This property captures the intuitive notion that the real number line has "no gaps" - wherever there should be a number, there is one.
>
> **The Squeeze Theorem**
>
> Also known as the Sandwich Theorem, this fundamental result in real analysis provides a powerful technique for evaluating limits when direct computation is difficult.
>
> **Proof Strategy**: If f(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x) and both f and h approach the same limit L as x approaches a, then g must also approach L. The proof uses the formal definition of limits and the comparison test.
>
> **Applications**: Essential for proving limits involving trigonometric functions, such as lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = 1.

## 🌐 Topology

### Example 4: Topological Spaces

**Lean Source** (`examples/classical/topology.lean`):
```lean
theorem open_sets_form_topology (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] :
  (∅ : Set X).IsOpen ∧
  (Set.univ : Set X).IsOpen ∧
  (∀ (𝒪 : Set (Set X)), (∀ U ∈ 𝒪, U.IsOpen) → (⋃ U ∈ 𝒪, U).IsOpen) ∧
  (∀ U V : Set X, U.IsOpen → V.IsOpen → (U ∩ V).IsOpen) := by
  exact ⟨isOpen_empty, isOpen_univ, isOpen_iUnion, isOpen_inter⟩

theorem hausdorff_separation (X : Type*) [TopologicalSpace X] [T2Space X]
  (x y : X) (h : x ≠ y) :
  ∃ U V : Set X, U.IsOpen ∧ V.IsOpen ∧ x ∈ U ∧ y ∈ V ∧ Disjoint U V := by
  exact T2Space.t2 h
```

**Generated Explanation**:
> **Topology Axioms**
>
> This theorem verifies that the collection of open sets in any topological space satisfies the three fundamental axioms that define a topology:
>
> 1. **Empty Set and Universal Set**: Both ∅ and X are open
> 2. **Arbitrary Unions**: Any union of open sets is open
> 3. **Finite Intersections**: The intersection of finitely many open sets is open
>
> **Hausdorff Separation Property**
>
> The Hausdorff property (T₂ separation) is one of the most important separation axioms in topology. It states that any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods.
>
> **Geometric Intuition**: Imagine two distinct points on a line - you can always find two non-overlapping intervals, one containing each point. This captures the intuitive notion that points are "separate" entities.
>
> **Significance**: Hausdorff spaces are "nice" - limits of sequences are unique, compact sets are closed, and many pathological behaviors are excluded.
