# Workflow Summary Comment
# This workflow implements a gradual improvement approach for alpha software:
# 1. Quality metrics are tracked but don't fail the build
# 2. Security scans run for awareness, not enforcement  
# 3. Only working tests are required to pass
# 4. New code must meet quality standards (Clean as You Code)
# 5. Performance is monitored to prevent regression
# 6. Technical debt is actively tracked and reduced
# 7. Documentation is built despite warnings
# 8. Release candidates acknowledge alpha status

# Estimated timeline to production-ready:
# - Week 1-2: Improve test coverage to 70%
# - Week 3-4: Fix critical security vulnerabilities
# - Week 5: Resolve core functionality issues  
# - Week 6: Final production preparation
