# Proof-Sketcher Repository Audit Report

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**Auditor**: DevOps Engineer
**Repository**: /Users/brightliu/Coding_Projects/proof-sketcher
**Current State**: Alpha Software with Significant Technical Debt

## Executive Summary

The proof-sketcher repository is in a state of significant disarray with numerous test/exploit files, deleted documentation, and modified source files. The project appears to have undergone extensive testing, including security exploit demonstrations, resulting in a cluttered repository that needs comprehensive cleanup before it can be considered for production use.

## 1. Current Repository Health Assessment

### Git Status Overview

- **Deleted Files**: 31 files (mostly documentation and design files)
- **Modified Files**: 62 source files
- **Untracked Files**: 65+ files (test scripts, exploits, demos)
- **Branch**: main (no proper branching strategy evident)

### Project Structure Analysis

**Positive Aspects**:

- Well-organized source code structure under `src/proof_sketcher/`
- Proper Python package setup with `pyproject.toml`
- Comprehensive test directory structure
- CI/CD workflows configured (though acknowledging alpha status)

**Major Issues**:

- Numerous exploit demonstration files in root directory
- Test/demo files scattered throughout the repository
- Deleted critical documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
- Mixed production and test artifacts
- Security vulnerability demonstration files present

### Code Quality Metrics (from CI/CD)

- **Test Coverage**: 11% (target: 70%)
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 69 identified
- **Linting Violations**: 3,625
- **Type Errors**: Unknown/many

## 2. Files to Remove/Clean Up

### High Priority - Security Risk Files

```
exploit_poc.py                  # Security vulnerability demonstrations
xss_exploit_demo.py            # XSS attack demonstrations
xss_simple_demo.py             # XSS examples
bypass_attempt_test.py         # Security bypass attempts
```

### Test/Demo Files in Root (Should be in tests/)

```
test_critical_error_handling.py
test_error_handling.py
test_real_batch_errors.py
concurrent_simulation.py
debug_generation.py
error_handling_final_report.py
final_performance_test.py
performance_stress_test.py
simple_performance_test.py
stress_test_resource_limits.py
university_stress_test.py
quick_stress_test.py
```

### Lean Test Files (Should be organized)

```
math_accuracy_test_basic.lean
math_accuracy_test_induction.lean
math_accuracy_test_logic.lean
test_theorem.lean
```

### Generated Reports (Should be in reports/ or docs/)

```
university_performance_report.json
final_error_handling_report.md
```

### Temporary Scripts (Should be reviewed and removed/moved)

```
scripts/final_import_fix.py
scripts/fix_all_test_imports.py
scripts/fix_test_imports.py
scripts/phase1_cleanup.py
scripts/ultimate_import_fix.py
```

## 3. Documentation Requiring Recreation

### Critical Missing Documentation

1. **README.md** - Main project documentation (DELETED)
   - Needs honest description of alpha status
   - Clear installation instructions
   - Realistic feature list
   - Known limitations

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines (DELETED)
   - Development setup
   - Code standards
   - Testing requirements
   - PR process

3. **SECURITY.md** - Security policy (DELETED)
   - Vulnerability reporting process
   - Known security issues
   - Security roadmap

4. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history (DELETED)
   - Track changes honestly
   - Document known issues

### Documentation with False Claims

The existing documentation in `docs/user/production-status.md` honestly acknowledges:

- 11% test coverage
- 69 security vulnerabilities
- Core functionality issues
- Alpha status

However, other documentation may contain overstated capabilities that need correction.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Current Setup

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Workflows Found**:
  - `ci.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline (honest about alpha status)
  - `release.yml` - Release automation
  - `codeql.yml` - Security scanning
  - `dependency-review.yml` - Dependency checks
  - `pre-commit.yml` - Code quality checks
  - `monitoring.yml` - Performance monitoring

### CI/CD Assessment

**Positive**:

- Acknowledges alpha status explicitly
- Continues on errors (appropriate for alpha)
- Tracks technical debt
- Implements "Clean as You Code" for new changes

**Issues**:

- Only 29/33 tests passing
- Security scans are informational only
- No enforcement of quality gates

## 6. Security and Sensitive Data Concerns

### Critical Security Issues

1. **Active Exploit Files**: Multiple files demonstrating security vulnerabilities
2. **XSS Vulnerabilities**: Template files with `autoescape=False`
3. **Path Traversal**: Demonstrated in exploit_poc.py
4. **No Secrets Found**: .gitignore properly excludes sensitive files

### Security Recommendations

1. Immediately remove all exploit demonstration files
2. Enable autoescaping in all Jinja2 templates
3. Implement proper input validation
4. Add security linting to CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Step-by-Step Cleanup Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Cleanup (Day 1)

```bash
# 1. Create cleanup branch
git checkout -b cleanup/security-and-structure

# 2. Remove security exploit files
git rm exploit_poc.py xss_exploit_demo.py xss_simple_demo.py bypass_attempt_test.py

# 3. Move test files to proper locations
mkdir -p tests/stress
git mv *_stress_test.py tests/stress/
git mv test_*.py tests/
git mv math_accuracy_test_*.lean tests/data/

# 4. Archive generated reports
mkdir -p docs/archive/reports
git mv university_performance_report.json docs/archive/reports/
git mv final_error_handling_report.md docs/archive/reports/
```

### Phase 2: Documentation Recreation (Day 1-2)

```bash
# 1. Create honest README.md
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# Proof-Sketcher

```

### Phase 3: Code Organization (Day 2-3)

```bash
# 1. Review and organize scripts
mkdir -p scripts/archive
git mv scripts/*_fix*.py scripts/archive/

# 2. Clean up untracked configuration files
git add .proof-sketcher.yaml .ruff.toml

# 3. Update .gitignore for new structure
echo "# Test artifacts" >> .gitignore
echo "tests/stress/reports/" >> .gitignore
```

### Phase 4: CI/CD Updates (Day 3)

1. Update workflows to reflect new structure
2. Add security scanning that fails on new vulnerabilities
3. Implement gradual quality gates
4. Set up proper branch protection

### Phase 5: Source Code Cleanup (Day 4-5)

1. Run automated formatters (black, isort)
2. Fix critical linting issues
3. Add type hints to public APIs
4. Document all public functions

### Phase 6: Testing Infrastructure (Day 5-6)

1. Fix failing tests
2. Add tests for critical paths
3. Set up code coverage tracking
4. Implement integration test suite

### Phase 7: Final Review (Day 7)

1. Full repository scan for remaining issues
2. Update all documentation
3. Create release notes
4. Tag as v0.0.2-alpha

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Remove all security exploit files immediately**
2. **Create honest documentation about alpha status**
3. **Move all test files to proper locations**
4. **Enable security scanning in CI/CD**

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

1. Achieve 50% test coverage
2. Fix HIGH security vulnerabilities
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Document all APIs

### Medium-term (1 month)

1. Achieve 70% test coverage
2. Fix all security vulnerabilities
3. Implement missing core features
4. Performance optimization

### Long-term (3 months)

1. Production-ready release
2. Full documentation suite
3. Comprehensive test coverage
4. Security compliance

## Conclusion

The proof-sketcher repository requires significant cleanup before it can be considered for production use. The presence of security exploit demonstrations, scattered test files, and deleted documentation indicates a project that has undergone extensive testing but needs professional cleanup and organization.

The good news is that the core architecture appears sound, and the CI/CD pipeline honestly acknowledges the alpha status. With focused effort following this cleanup plan, the repository can be transformed into a production-ready state within 2-3 months.

**Priority**: Remove security exploit files immediately to prevent any potential misuse.
