# Production Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-08  
**Version**: 0.1.0-alpha  
**Status**: NOT PRODUCTION READY

## Executive Summary

Proof Sketcher is currently in **alpha development** with significant limitations that prevent production use. While the basic architecture is sound, critical issues in security, functionality, and code quality require resolution before deployment.

| Template Output | ‚úÖ Working | Fair | HTML, Markdown, Jupyter |
| Offline Mode | ‚úÖ Working | Fair | No external dependencies |
| Project Structure | ‚úÖ Good | Good | Well-organized codebase |

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

| Feature | Status | Issue | Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| AI Integration | ‚ùå Broken | API not functional | No real explanations |
| Theorem Parsing | ‚ùå Limited | Empty statements | Core functionality broken |
| Animations | ‚ùå Broken | Manim integration failed | No visualizations |
| Security | ‚ùå Critical | 69 vulnerabilities | Production blocker |
| Test Coverage | ‚ùå Poor | 11% coverage | High bug risk |

## Critical Issues

### Security Vulnerabilities

**Total**: 69 vulnerabilities (6 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM, 59 LOW)

**Critical Issues**:
- Unsafe pickle deserialization (4 instances)
- XSS vulnerability in templates (autoescape=False)
- Weak MD5 hash usage
- 20 vulnerable dependencies

**Risk Level**: üö® CRITICAL - Do not deploy to production

### Core Functionality Problems

**Theorem Parsing**:
- Lean extractor build failures
- Empty theorem statements in output
- Falls back to basic text parsing

**Content Generation**:
- AI integration not functional
- Offline mode produces generic templates only
- No theorem-specific explanations

**Performance**:
- 30+ seconds for simple theorems
- Unknown memory usage patterns
- No concurrent processing

### Code Quality Issues

**Linting Violations**: 3,625 total
- 466 lines too long
- 2,352 blank lines with whitespace
- 143 trailing whitespace issues
- 60 unused imports
- 5 bare except clauses

**Test Coverage**: 11% (Target: 70%+)
- 6 test modules fail to import
- Most integration tests broken
- Only 29/33 tests passing

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 4: Production Preparation (4-6 weeks)

#### Week 1: Security Fixes (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix unsafe pickle usage
- [ ] Address XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Implement input validation

#### Week 2: Core Functionality (HIGH)
- [ ] Fix Lean extractor build system
- [ ] Implement proper theorem parsing
- [ ] Generate meaningful content
- [ ] Test with real theorems

#### Week 3: Code Quality (HIGH)
- [ ] Fix critical linting violations
- [ ] Implement automated formatting
- [ ] Add comprehensive type annotations
- [ ] Improve error handling

#### Week 4: Testing and Coverage (MEDIUM)
- [ ] Fix broken test modules
- [ ] Expand test coverage to 70%+
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

#### Weeks 5-6: Performance and Documentation (LOW)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Deployment guides
- [ ] Monitoring setup

## Success Criteria for Production

### Must Have (Blockers)
- [ ] **Zero high/critical security vulnerabilities**
- [ ] **Functional theorem parsing** with actual content
- [ ] **<100 linting violations** (from 3,625)
- [ ] **70%+ test coverage** (from 11%)
- [ ] **<5 second processing** for simple theorems

### Should Have (Important)
- [ ] Complete user documentation
- [ ] Deployment and monitoring setup
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms

### Nice to Have (Future)
- [ ] Real AI integration
- [ ] Working animation system
- [ ] Advanced mathematical notation
- [ ] Multi-language support

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Security**: Critical vulnerabilities present
2. **Reliability**: Low test coverage, unknown edge cases
3. **Performance**: Slow processing, potential memory issues
4. **Maintainability**: Poor code quality metrics

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Security**: Immediate patching and dependency updates
2. **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing and error handling
3. **Performance**: Profiling and optimization
4. **Maintainability**: Code quality standards and automation

## Current Limitations for Users

### What Users Can Do
- ‚úÖ Test basic CLI functionality
- ‚úÖ Generate template-based outputs
- ‚úÖ Process simple Lean files (with limitations)
- ‚úÖ Contribute to development

### What Users Cannot Do
- ‚ùå Deploy to production environments
- ‚ùå Get meaningful theorem explanations
- ‚ùå Use AI-powered features
- ‚ùå Generate animations
- ‚ùå Process complex mathematical content reliably

## Recommended Actions

### For Potential Users
1. **Wait for production release** (estimated 4-6 weeks)
2. **Use only for development/testing**
3. **Do not deploy in production environments**
4. **Report issues and contribute fixes**

### For Contributors
1. **Focus on security fixes first**
2. **Address core parsing functionality**
3. **Improve test coverage**
4. **Follow established development guidelines**

### For Stakeholders
1. **Plan for 4-6 week development timeline**
2. **Allocate resources for security fixes**
3. **Consider postponing production deployment**
4. **Invest in quality assurance processes**

## Conclusion

While Proof Sketcher has a solid architectural foundation and working CLI interface, **critical security and functionality issues prevent production deployment**. The estimated timeline for production readiness is **4-6 weeks** with focused development effort.

**Recommendation**: Continue development with emphasis on security fixes and core functionality before considering production use.
