## 🔧 Issue Management Workflow

### 1. Initial Triage (Within 24 hours)

**For all new issues:**

1. Apply appropriate labels (type, component, priority)
2. Ask for clarification if needed (`needs-more-info`)
3. Provide initial response and timeline
4. Assign to milestone if appropriate

**For bug reports:**

1. Attempt to reproduce the issue
2. Add `needs-reproduction` if unable to reproduce
3. Escalate critical issues immediately
4. Create test cases for confirmed bugs

**For feature requests:**

1. Evaluate against roadmap and project goals
2. Ask for additional use case details
3. Mark as `enhancement` and appropriate priority
4. Consider community voting if uncertain

### 2. Active Work (Regular intervals)

**Weekly review:**

- Update progress on all in-progress issues
- Identify blocked issues and work to unblock
- Reassess priorities based on new information
- Communicate status changes to stakeholders

**Release planning:**

- Group related issues into milestones
- Balance new features with bug fixes
- Consider community feedback in prioritization
- Set realistic timelines with buffer for testing

### 3. Resolution & Follow-up

**For completed issues:**

1. Test thoroughly before closing
2. Update documentation if needed
3. Communicate resolution to issue reporter
4. Ask for confirmation that issue is resolved
5. Include in release notes

**For rejected/wontfix issues:**

## 🎓 Educational Response Framework

### For Mathematical Accuracy Issues

```markdown
Thank you for pointing out this mathematical concern! 🔍

Mathematical accuracy is our top priority. I take all such reports very seriously.

**My investigation:**
1. I'll review the specific theorem and generated explanation
2. I'll consult mathematical literature to verify correctness
3. I'll identify the root cause (parsing, generation, or template issue)
4. I'll implement a fix with additional test cases

**Timeline:** 24-48 hours for investigation, fix within 1 week

**Help needed:** If you have references to authoritative sources or can suggest specific improvements, that would be incredibly helpful!

This is exactly the kind of feedback that makes Proof Sketcher better. Thank you for your diligence! 🙏
```

### For Performance Issues

```markdown
Thanks for reporting this performance issue! ⚡

Performance is crucial for practical adoption, especially with large mathematical libraries.

**Could you provide:**
- File size and theorem count of input
- Your system specifications (OS, RAM, CPU)
- Expected vs actual processing time
- Any error messages or resource warnings

**My process:**
1. Reproduce the issue with similar input
2. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations and test thoroughly
4. Validate improvement with your use case

**Workaround:** In the meantime, try using `--workers 2` or `--memory-limit 1024` to reduce resource usage.

Thanks for helping make Proof Sketcher faster for everyone! 🚀
```

### For Integration/Workflow Issues

```markdown
Thank you for sharing your workflow challenge! 🔧

I want Proof Sketcher to integrate seamlessly with existing mathematical development workflows.

**Understanding your setup:**
- What's your current process for mathematical documentation?
- Which tools do you use (VS Code, Emacs, command line)?
- What's your typical project structure?
- Where does Proof Sketcher fit (or not fit) currently?

**My goal:**
Make Proof Sketcher work naturally within your existing workflow, not replace it.

**Possible solutions:**
[Suggest relevant options based on the specific issue]

Your feedback helps ensure Proof Sketcher serves real mathematical work, not just demos. Thank you! 🎯
