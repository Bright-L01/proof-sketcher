# Proof Sketcher

**‚ö†Ô∏è ALPHA SOFTWARE - EARLY DEVELOPMENT STAGE ‚ö†Ô∏è**

An experimental tool for generating natural language explanations of Lean 4 theorems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status: Development Phase

**This software is in early alpha development.** Many features are incomplete or experimental. See [Known Issues](#-known-issues) before using.

### What Currently Works ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **CLI Interface**: Functional command-line interface
- ‚úÖ **Basic Processing**: Can process Lean files and extract basic theorem information
- ‚úÖ **Multi-format Export**: Generates HTML, Markdown, and Jupyter notebook outputs
- ‚úÖ **Offline Mode**: Template-based explanation generation (no AI required)
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure**: Well-organized codebase with modular design

### What Doesn't Work Yet ‚ùå

- ‚ùå **AI Integration**: Claude API integration not fully functional
- ‚ùå **Lean Parsing**: Limited theorem extraction (often produces empty statements)
- ‚ùå **Animations**: Manim integration incomplete
- ‚ùå **Content Quality**: Generates generic template content, not theorem-specific explanations
- ‚ùå **Production Ready**: Multiple security and quality issues (see [Production Readiness](#-production-readiness))

## üöÄ Quick Start (Alpha Testing)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Lean 4 with Elan (optional - basic functionality works without)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proof-sketcher
cd proof-sketcher

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Create a simple test file
echo 'theorem test : 1 = 1 := rfl' > test.lean

# Generate documentation (offline mode)
python -m proof_sketcher prove test.lean --offline --format markdown

# Check output
ls output/
```

**Expected Output**: Basic HTML/Markdown files with template content (not theorem-specific content yet).

## üìã Current Capabilities

### Working Features

1. **Command-Line Interface**
   ```bash
   python -m proof_sketcher --help
   python -m proof_sketcher prove file.lean --offline
   python -m proof_sketcher batch directory/ --offline
   ```

2. **File Processing**
   - Reads Lean files
   - Attempts basic theorem extraction
   - Generates structured output files

3. **Export Formats**
   - HTML with CSS styling
   - Markdown with LaTeX math
   - Jupyter notebooks (basic)

4. **Offline Mode**
   - Works without external API dependencies
   - Generates template-based explanations
   - Suitable for testing and development

### Experimental Features

- **Batch Processing**: Can process multiple files
- **Caching System**: Basic caching implementation
- **Configuration**: YAML-based configuration support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Critical Issues
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: 69 security issues identified (6 HIGH severity)
- **Empty Content**: Theorem statements often empty in output
- **Build Failures**: Lean extractor fails to build properly
- **Generic Output**: Explanations are template-based, not theorem-specific

### Code Quality Issues
- 3,625 linting violations
- 11% test coverage
- Multiple test modules broken
- Inconsistent formatting

### Limitations
- No real AI integration yet
- Limited Lean 4 parsing capabilities
- Animations not functional
- Performance issues (30+ seconds for simple theorems)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### For Contributors

```bash
# Clone and setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proof-sketcher
cd proof-sketcher

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests (many currently broken)
pytest

# Check code quality
flake8 src/proof_sketcher/
black --check src/proof_sketcher/
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run working tests only
pytest tests/test_core_utils.py tests/unit/test_coverage_boost.py

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=src/proof_sketcher --cov-report=html
```

**Current Test Status**: 29/33 tests passing, 11% coverage

## üìä Production Readiness

**Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY**

| Component | Status | Issues |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Security | ‚ùå Critical | 69 vulnerabilities |
| Code Quality | ‚ùå Poor | 3,625 violations |
| Test Coverage | ‚ùå Low | 11% coverage |
| Core Functionality | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | Basic parsing only |
| Documentation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | This document |

**Estimated time to production readiness**: 4-6 weeks of focused development.

## üîß Configuration

Create `.proof-sketcher.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
# Basic configuration
generation:
  offline_mode: true  # Recommended for current version
  timeout_seconds: 60

export:
  formats: ["html", "markdown"]
  output_dir: "output"
  
# Development settings
debug: true
verbose_logging: true
```
