# Proof-Sketcher Functionality Validation Report

## Executive Summary

This report validates the claimed functionality of the proof-sketcher tool against its actual implementation. The tool is currently in **alpha version 0.0.1a1** and has significant discrepancies between what is documented and what actually works.

## Key Findings

### 1. **NO AI Integration Despite Claims**

**Claimed**: The documentation extensively mentions AI-powered explanations, Claude integration, and natural language generation.

**Reality**: 
- All generation is **template-based**, not AI-powered
- The `AIGenerator` class is just an alias for `SimpleGenerator` (template-based)
- Comments in code explicitly state: "Despite the naming, this module currently uses TEMPLATE-BASED generation, not AI language models"
- The "AI" and "Claude" class names are legacy from planned features that were never implemented

### 2. **Working Features**

The following commands and features actually work:

✅ **Core Commands**:
- `proof-sketcher list-theorems [file]` - Lists theorems in a Lean file
- `proof-sketcher prove [file] --theorem [name]` - Generates template-based explanations
- `proof-sketcher batch [directory]` - Batch processes multiple files
- `proof-sketcher config --show` - Shows configuration
- `proof-sketcher version` - Shows version info

✅ **Export Formats**:
- HTML export works (with MathJax rendering)
- Markdown export works
- `--format all` generates both formats

✅ **Basic Functionality**:
- Parses Lean files to extract theorem names and statements
- Generates generic, template-based explanations
- Creates output files in specified formats
- Basic error handling and path sanitization

### 3. **Non-Functional Features**

❌ **LSP Integration**:
- Code explicitly states: "DEPRECATED: This LSP client is non-functional"
- LSP is "1000x slower than simple parser and extracts 0 theorems"
- Config shows `Use LSP: False` by default

❌ **AI Features**:
- `proof-sketcher enhance --ai` returns "AI enhancements not yet available"
- No actual Claude API integration despite documentation claims
- No real natural language generation

❌ **Caching**:
- `proof-sketcher cache --show` returns "Not implemented in alpha version"
- Cache functionality is stubbed but not operational

❌ **Advanced Features**:
- No animations (Manim integration)
- No interactive features
- No progressive difficulty levels
- No semantic analysis of proofs

### 4. **Misleading Documentation**

The documentation makes several false or misleading claims:

1. **User Guide** mentions "Claude CLI" requirement and AI generation extensively
2. **CLI Reference** documents cache commands that don't work
3. **README** correctly notes it's alpha software but doesn't clarify the template-only nature
4. **Educational levels** are mentioned but all generate similar generic content

### 5. **Quality of Generated Content**

The generated explanations are:
- **Generic and non-specific** to the actual theorem
- **Template-based** with pattern matching on theorem names
- **Lacking mathematical accuracy** - just placeholder text
- **Identical structure** regardless of theorem complexity

Example output for `add_zero`:
```
This theorem shows that two mathematical expressions are actually the same thing, just written differently.
```

This same template is used for many different theorems with minor variations.

## Validation Tests Performed

1. ✅ Listed theorems from example files
2. ✅ Generated explanations in Markdown and HTML formats
3. ✅ Tested batch processing
4. ✅ Checked configuration display
5. ❌ Attempted to use AI enhancements (not implemented)
6. ❌ Tested caching functionality (not implemented)
7. ✅ Verified template-based generation in source code
8. ✅ Confirmed LSP deprecation in code comments

## Conclusions

1. **The tool works** but only provides basic template-based explanations
2. **No AI integration exists** despite extensive documentation suggesting otherwise
3. **Alpha status warning is accurate** - this is very early software
4. **Core parsing and export functionality is stable**
5. **Generated content has minimal educational value** due to generic templates

## Recommendations

1. **Update documentation** to clearly state this is template-based, not AI-powered
2. **Remove or clarify** references to Claude CLI and AI features
3. **Set proper expectations** about the generic nature of explanations
4. **Focus marketing** on the working features: Lean parsing and multi-format export
5. **Consider renaming** classes to remove "AI" and "Claude" references

## Honest Assessment

This is a functional **Lean theorem documentation generator** that creates structured HTML/Markdown files from Lean source files. It is **NOT** an AI-powered explanation system, despite what the documentation suggests. The tool has value as a basic documentation generator but should not be presented as having AI capabilities it doesn't possess.
